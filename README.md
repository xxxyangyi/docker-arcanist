Arcanist as a Docker container
==============================

We provide a `nasqueron/arcanist` image to run **Arcanist** as a Docker container.

Our goal is to be able to use `arc` when we tweak a Docker image on a Docker engine server, where PHP isn't installed. To have an Arcanist image allows us not to install PHP everywhere.

Installation
------------

You only have to pull our image, then invoke a shell or Arc directly:

```
docker pull nasqueron/arcanist

docker run -it --rm nasqueron/arcanist bash
docker run -it --rm nasqueron/arcanist arc anoid
```

Configuration and workspace volumes
-----------------------------------

We provide two volumes, one to store the configuration (.arcrc, .gitconfig), one to store the repository you want to work with.

You probably want to pass the current directory as workspace directory. Use `pwd` (Docker won' t like `.`, and the Docker client could be on another machine than the server by the way).

To store the configuration, create a `~/.arc` folder with:

 - `~/.arc/arcrc`: a copy of your .arcrc file
 - `~/.arc/gitconfig` : a copy of your .gitconfig file

I want an arc command
---------------------

It could be convenient to create a wrapper script in `/usr/local/bin/arc` to be able to directly write `arc diff`:

```
cat > /usr/local/bin/arc
#!/bin/sh

if [ "$1" = "shell" ]; then
        shift
        COMMAND=bash
else
        mkdir -p ~/.arc
        COMMAND=arc
fi

docker run -it --rm -v ~/.arc:/opt/config -v `pwd`:/opt/workspace nasqueron/arcanist $COMMAND $*
```

You can now use `arc shell` to get an interactive shell with your local directory content sent to the container, and `arc <whatever>` in other cases.

> **Note:**

> If you use `arc call-conduit` you can't use -it, as you need to pass stdin to the command.
